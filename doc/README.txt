INSTALLATION

Note that 4.09 includes a new css structure and that upgrading from previous version will require that the browser cache is cleared for the new css to render correctly.

Installation is largely automatic having extracted the archive to a directory under the web-server's root and then browsing to this directory. The installation script will display with guidance on how to proceed.

Detailed installation instructions are in the file doc/INSTALL.txt in the doc directory. If you have trouble installing with the automated script, it is important to read the INSTALL.txt file in its entirety before proceeding manually. A printout is recommended.

DOCUMENTATION

The user documentation contains a wealth of information and is installed under the doc/Manual directory in html format. Links to it are available from the application itself. There is also a wiki at http://www.weberp.org/wiki/ that contains some how-tos descriptions of specification for the original developments.

The change log at:

http://web-erp.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/web-erp/trunk/doc/Change.log

lists all changes and the dates they were made.


SUPPORT

The primary means of support queries is through the forum at http://www.weberp.org/forum or the user mailing list.
Please join the list at: http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/web-erp-users

Feedback, wants and gripes are encouraged in the interests of improving the applicaton.
